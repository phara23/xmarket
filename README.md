# xmarket
An open source market making engine and network. 

#The Vision
The role of market makers is a pivotal but often over looked one. Financial markets need them to price assets and a growing number of businesses act as market makers for goods and services, Uber and AirBnb for example. Given the wide spread need for market making in modern commerce, as well as the philosophical importance of an honest, consistent and fair market making service it seems appropriate that an open source alternative should exist. That alternative is what this project is. 

XMarket will aim to be a complete suite, allowing the seamless creation and deployment of customizeable, scaleable market making services. This suite will be a distributer peer to peer network that allows the creation of custom market making instances according to the creators specific needs. The p2p nodes in the network will be incentivized by a commission on the market making they facilitate. The suite will be comprised of the following individual parts:

1. Pricing Engine

  * Queing System

  * Dynamic Preferences

    * Centralized/Decentralized

    * Geo sensitive

    * Commission or spread based
    * Accepted market order types 
  * Core Logic
2. Distributed Network & Decentralization Preferences
3. Consensus Protocol

#Baby Steps
Obviously, a project like the one detailed is not built in a day. The following is our ToDo list to get started.
1. Complete the map above
2. Select what components of the price engine should be built in our first run through.
3. Work out logic, math and flows for the chosed components of the price engine chosen in part 2.
4. Build psuedocode to do the job detailed in part 4.
5. Choose a language of implementation and build what we have designed.
