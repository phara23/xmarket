# bitmarket
An open source market making engine and network. 

#The Vision
The role of market makers is a pivotal but often over looked one. Financial markets need them to price assets and a growing number of businesses act as market makers for goods and services, Uber and AirBnb for example. Given the wide spread need for market making in modern commerce, as well as the philosophical importance of an honest, consistent and fair market making service it seems appropriate that an open source alternative should exist. That alternative is what this project is. 

XMarket will aim to be a complete suite, allowing the seamless creation and deployment of customizeable, scaleable market making services. This suite will be a distributer peer to peer network that allows the creation of custom market making instances according to the creators specific needs. The p2p nodes in the network will be incentivized by a commission on the market making they facilitate. 

The suite will be comprised of the following individual parts show in the below map:

1. Pricing Engine

  * Queing System

  * Dynamic Preferences
    
    * Asset preferences

      * Asset is geo sensitive or not
    
      * Assest is digital or physical
      
      * Asset type
      
        * Services
        
        * Financial assets
        
        * Retail goods
        
        * Unique goods, eg real estate
        
  * Core Logic
2. Distributed Network & Decentralization Preferences
3. Consensus Protocol
4. Marketplace 
  * Market preferences

     * Commission or spread based
    
     * Accepted market order types 
       
     * Centralized/Decentralized
       
     * Only match orders or take other side in orders. 

#Baby Steps
Obviously, a project like the one detailed is not built in a day. The following is our ToDo list to get started.

1. Complete the map above

2. Select what components of the price engine should be built first and what dynamic preferences to build into the first iteration. 

3. Work out logic, math and flows for the components of the price engine chosen in part 2.

4. Build psuedocode to do the job detailed in part 3.

5. Choose a language of implementation and build what we have designed.

Dynamic preferences for first iteration:

1. Asset is not geo sensitive. 

2. Asset is digital

3. Accept buy and sell market and limit orders 

4. Spread based market


#Random musings to integrate into ReadMe
Market making can take place in several form. Firstly, a market maker could exist only to match buy and sell orders from market participants with each other. Doing this, the marker maker would assume no real risk while market making. Market makers may also choose to have some of the given asset and cash on hand to buy and sell directly from market participants, allowing them to take on additional risk compared to the aforementioned stategy, but to earn more as market markers. 

The spread would allow nodes in a distributed network to be rewarded for hosting and contributing to the network. In order to be secure this decentralized network would use similar cryptographic technologies to those used in Bitcoin, including but not limited to the concept of a blockchain. Having markets made over a decentralized network would have many advantages, including:

1. Faster and more even execution times.
